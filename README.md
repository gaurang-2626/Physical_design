# Physical_design:-
Physical design refers to the phase in the process of creating computer chips where the detailed physical layout of the circuitry is determined. In simpler terms, it's like designing the blueprint or map of how all the tiny electronic components (like transistors and wires) will be arranged on a computer chip.

# NASSCOM-VSD-PD-WORKSHOP
it consisted of 5 day workshop conducted by VSD and NASSCOM on RTL 2 GDS flow.
a brief introduction was given about frontend and main focus was on backend flow.
VSD-IAT cloud platform was used to provide acess to lectures.

## WORKSHOP FLOW:-
1.Introduction to open source eda tool(openlane) and PDK(skywater130nm).

2.Floorplanning and Powerplanning.

3.cell design using Magic Layout and Ngspice characterization.

4.Pre-layout timing analysis and importance to good clock tress(i.e minimum skewness).

5.Final steps for RTL2GDS flow.

This is arduino uno board,the encircled part is the processor which we are concerned about.
we will be doing physical design of macro present inside the processor.(i.e)we will be implementing block level design.
