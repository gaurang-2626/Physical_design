# Physical_design:-
Physical design refers to the phase in the process of creating computer chips where the detailed physical layout of the circuitry is determined. In simpler terms, it's like designing the blueprint or map of how all the tiny electronic components (like transistors and wires) will be arranged on a computer chip.
